Tiny Catalyst program to play with...

  Yxes::Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Google

Though it's inherently difficult to write decent test
scripts for any Catalyst Authentication plugin, using
oAuth2 with Google is nearly impossible without the
ability to actually contact Google (and they have no
way to do that as a test).  I've done the best I
could with the test scripts on board (make test) but
it's never exactly what you want, so this allows me
to test the actual code against a 'real' server.

If you'd like to 'try before you buy'...
(where "buy" in this case means "install")

PERL LIBRARIES

I use four "non-standard" Catalyst libraries. They
are:

  * Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie
  * Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap
  * Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication
  * Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles

You can ensure that everything is installed by issuing

  * perl Makefile.PL
  * make

 [ I have no test scripts with this package so you 
   don't bother running 'make test' ]

GOOGLE CLIENT ID AND SECRET

Make certain you have a Google 'Client ID' and 'Client
secret' - as outlined in the README file that comes with

Yxes::Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Google

[ be sure that your Client ID and secret have a
  Redirect URI with http://localhost:3000/login ]

Armed with your shiny new Client ID and Client secret
edit the file:

lib/MyApp.pm

and change client_id and client_secret in that file to
their respective values.  

RUN THE SERVER

This package looks for the above library relative to
it's location so you'll want to run it from this 
directory using...

script/myapp_server.pl

to test the application.

Then hit the following URLs...

* Be sure that the server is running
  http://localhost:3000/

* Attempt to bring up a page you don't have access to
  http://localhost:3000/welcome
  This should take you to Google for authentication

* Finally observe that you ended up at
  http://localhost:3000/login
  and attempt to bring up the 'welcome' page again
  http://localhost:3000/welcome

* RESET EVERYTHING
  - stop the server CTRL-C
  - Remove your authentication link from Google at
    https://accounts.google.com/b/0/IssuedAuthSubTokens?hl=en
  - Remove the Session file
    rm tmp/session
  - Delete the cookie on your browser
    [depends on which browser you're using]

* See what happens if you tell Google that you won't allow
  access to the application...
  - start the server
  - http://localhost:3000/welcome
  - when you are redirected don't allow access
  - the login page should give you an error

REAL ERRORS???

* If you get an error when you are redirected to Google...

  [ review the ../../README file again for retrieving your 
    Google values ]

  - take a look at ./lib/MyApp.pm again and ensure you entered
    the correct ID and secret key for your application

  - Ensure that your Redirect URI is setup with Google
    ie: http://localhost:3000/login

				--- Good Luck :)

[optional]
Yxes::Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Roles

Add your gmail address to the local database by editing the
file:

 db/myapp.sql

replace 'nobody@gmail.comma' with your gmail address
and then run:

 sqlite3 db/myapp.db < db/myapp.sql

Next, you'll need to edit the configuration file to 
get setup to use the Roles method.  Take a look at

 myapp.conf

for details on editing that file.

When you're done, start the server as noted above and
try running the tests above.  After you've logged in
you should be able to check the sqlite database and
see that your Google information is now stored there.

 sqlite3 db/myapp.db
 sqlite> select * from users;

[technical - you probably won't need this...]

If you make changes to the database structure as 
opposed to just updates to the data, you may need
to reload the database for DBIx using the command:

perl script/myapp_create.pl model MyAppDB DBIC::Schema MyApp::Schema::MyAppDB create=static dbi:SQLite:dbname=./db/myapp.db
